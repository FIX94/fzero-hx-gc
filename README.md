# fzero_hx_gc
A exploit for the original f-zero gx on gamecube, you only need a method of injecting the .gci onto your memory card.  
This exploit will load a boot.dol converted with dol2gci (included in Home Bros.) from your memory card.  
To trigger the exploit, simply go into the "REPLAY" menu. Note that you should not have any saved replays already or it wont work.  
When something is inserted into slot b, it will first display that slot, in that case just replug your memory card in slot a when the slot b replay screen is shown.
